This was an early project of mine in which I used graph algorithms and self-implemented data structures in order to create a text-based implementation of the popular board game "Ticket To Ride."  The /library/ folder contains my implementations for various data structures.  Graph-algorithms-inl.h contains my implementation of a few graph algorithms, including Djikstra's Algorithm.  Testgraph.cpp contains some test cases for these algorithms, and for my Ticket To Ride implementation.  The actual "game" code is in ticketToRide.cpp.
